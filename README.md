The goal of this project is to create a simplistic, static webpage directly with C++. This will be a library which offers a bunch of components which describes the whole user interface and outputs the desired HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) to a file. In addition to this, the users can create their own components on the top the built-in widgets. This will allow the users to create simple websites without learning HTML and CSS.
